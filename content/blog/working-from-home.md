## How to take care of yourself when working from home.

Remote work can have a serious impact on your life and (mental) health. I've been there myself. Especially when you can’t leave the house for extended periods of time. A lot of people are going to experience this for the first time now. So sharing some tips and learnings from the years I've worked remotely.

- **Stick to your regular routines.** Work reasonable hours and make sure to stick to start and end times. It's easy to be available all the time and work overtime. Start your day you would normally do. Grab your breakfast, take a shower and dress like you're going out in the morning.

- **Get outside.** Don't spend your time at home the whole day. Go outside for some fresh air. Go for a walk, a cycle or even some exercises, if possible. A walk in the morning sets the tone for the rest of your day. A walk the end of your day helps you unwind and switch off.

- **Actively communicate with others.** We are social creatures. We need to connect and share our lives with others. So let them know what you're doing; when you're available, when you're doing focused work or when you're on a break. Working from home should almost feel like overcommunicating. They can't see if you're away from your desk or sitting with your headphones on.

- **Proactively manage isolation.** The first few days might seem amazing to work from home, but reality will sooner or later kick in and you'll start to feel isolated. Make sure to stay connected with people. Plan additional time to catch-up, drink a virtual coffee together or hang around the watercooler. Turn on your webcam or pick up your phone. Stay connected with your friends and family after work.

- **Set up your boundaries.** Have a dedicated place to work. This is even more important when you're working from home with multiple people. Don't work from your bed or couch. Don't eat behind your laptop. It helps with fewer distractions during work but also separates work from home.

- **Stay healthy & fit.** When you're working from home all day it's so tempting to just stay there and neglect yourself. It takes more effort to go outside. Make sure to take breaks away from your screen. Hit the gym, go for a run or any other exercise. Think about your grocery shopping and skip the junk food. Buy some healthy snacks and fruits. Eat healthily and stay hydrated.

All the time you save from commuting every day can be spent on something useful to you. More time with your family, friends and loved ones. You can pick up that book that you always wanted to read. A new hobby, a side-project or just more time to relax and sleep.


Stay safe. Stay healthy!
