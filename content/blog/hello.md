Launching a personal blog. How exciting!

Because I've never been a very active blogger, the few times that I wrote, I posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@wslyvh). Mainly due to lack of ownership of my own data I decided to migrate away and build my own blog. Which was also a nice opportunity to play around with the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/).

This blog is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) + CMS and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). What can you expect here? We'll figure that out later... But most likely a combination of blockchain, tech, open-source software and anything related to building products and teams.
