There are a ton of courses where you can learn about blockchain, crypto and web3 development. Right from your home and at your own pace. Most of them are free. Or have free introductory lessons that will help you get started and try out the course material before purchasing.

Here are a few recommended courses that I have experience with myself or through others.


# a16z’s Crypto Startup School

https://a16z.com/crypto-startup-school/

This is really one of the best overviews with hours of videos, lectures, presentations, real-world insights and fireside chats from some of the best minds in the space. 


# ConsenSys Academy @ConsenSysAcad
https://consensys.net/academy/

World class programs from one of the leading companies in the space. They offer free, on-demand courses and webinars that will help you get started. Or get the skills you need to become an industry-leading Ethereum developer with their flagship Blockchain Developer Bootcamp and their certificate programs. 

Next bootcamp is scheduled for Sept. 1st 2021.

I've been through this one myself and can highly recommend it.


# Blockchain Berkeley @CalBlockchain

Blockchain at Berkeley, is an organization dedicated to becoming the blockchain hub of the East Bay. They debuted the world’s first undergraduate university-accredited blockchain course, Blockchain Fundamentals. And now have several courses on blockchain technology, fundamentals and development.

They offer several courses free of charge

# Chainshot @TeamChainShot

# MIT OpenCourseWare MITOCW

This course is for students wishing to explore blockchain technology's potential use—by entrepreneurs and incumbents—to change the world of money and finance. The course begins with a review of Bitcoin and an understanding of the commercial, technical, and public policy fundamentals of blockchain technology, distributed ledgers, and smart contracts. The class then continues on to current and potential blockchain applications in the financial sector. 


# Other
And lastly, there's a ton of courses, both free and paid on sites like @udemy and @coursera 

Coursera offers a few courses from respected organizations (such as ConsenSys). While Udemy has a huge range for different levels, at relatively low costs. Make sure to check out the reviews before any purchases.
